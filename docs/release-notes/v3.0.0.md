# Mizban v3 is Here — Faster Than Ever, Now Rewritten in Go


## What is new in v3.0.0

Mizban v3 is a full server rewrite in Go, focused on LAN transfer speed, low overhead, and simpler operation.

- Rewritten backend from Python to Go while preserving core product behavior.
- Single-binary runtime model across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- LAN client UI remains at `/` for uploads/downloads as before.
- New localhost-only admin page at `/settings` for configuration and operational controls.

## Performance improvements

This release focuses on using available LAN bandwidth more effectively, especially on Wi-Fi.

- Parallel range-based download path (default `parallel_chunks = 8`).
- Parallel chunked upload path with concurrent chunk writes and atomic finalize.
- Streaming I/O path for large files (no full-file buffering in RAM).
- HTTP server socket tuning and stable high-concurrency behavior.

For realistic throughput validation, compare Mizban transfer speed against your own `iperf3` baseline on the same network.

## Faster startup and smaller distribution

- Lean Go binary build using stripped linker flags (`-ldflags="-s -w"`).
- Reduced runtime dependencies and lower startup overhead.
- Frontend asset fallback embedded in binary for standalone execution scenarios.

## UX and operations changes

- QR code is shown in terminal at startup for quick client access.
- Local admin page (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/settings`) includes:
  - Shared folder path update
  - Port update
  - Parallel chunk and file-size limits
  - Restart endpoint for applying pending runtime changes (like port updates)
- Admin APIs are loopback-only to avoid exposing host controls on LAN.

## Compatibility and behavior continuity

The rewrite keeps existing expectations as stable as possible:

- Same shared-folder model (`MizbanShared` default behavior).
- Existing frontend flows are preserved.
- Backward-compatible config semantics and persisted config file usage.
- Same single-file sharing approach, no auth, no mDNS.

## Packaging and release assets

Published assets include:

- Linux: raw binaries and `.deb` packages
- Windows: `.exe` assets and portable archives
- macOS: `.dmg` and `.pkg`
- Portable archives and checksum file (`SHA256SUMS.txt`)

## Upgrade note

If you are upgrading from older Mizban versions:

- Keep your existing config file; v3 reads compatible settings.
- Review `/settings` after upgrade to confirm preferred port/path/chunk values.
- Re-test throughput on your network and tune `parallel_chunks` and `chunk_size_bytes` when needed.
