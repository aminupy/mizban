## Our commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and discuss ideas, not people.
- Give and receive feedback professionally.
- Focus on what is best for the project and community.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.
- Personal attacks, insults, or intimidation.
- Publishing private information without permission.
- Any behavior that is inappropriate in a professional open source community.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this code of conduct and may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this code.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact maintainers through GitHub by opening a private security advisory draft:
